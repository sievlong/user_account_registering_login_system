# User Account Registration and Login System

Welcome to the User Account Registration and Login System!

## Overview

This system allows users to register new accounts, log in to existing accounts, and manage user accounts through an administrative interface. It provides a simple and secure way to handle user authentication and account management.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register new accounts by providing their information such as username, email, age, and gender.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts securely using their username and password.
- **Administrative Interface**: Administrators can view a list of user accounts, update user information, and delete user accounts if needed. (admin username: admin | password: admin)
- **Password Generation**: Users have the option to generate strong passwords automatically during registration.
- **Account Persistence**: User account information is stored in a text file (`accounts.txt`) for persistence across sessions.

## Getting Started

You can get started with the User Account Registration and Login System by following these steps:

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository to your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sievlong/user_account_registering_login_system.git
```
# Install Required Packages
Before running the program, make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install easygui
```

# Download ZIP Folder
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP folder containing the executable file and accounts.txt. Once downloaded, extract the contents to a location of your choice on your computer.

## Important Note

**Antivirus Software Warning:** Some antivirus software may detect the executable file and the ZIP folder containing it as potential threats. This is a false positive, and the system is not a virus. It's common for executable files and compressed folders to trigger antivirus alerts, especially if they're not widely recognized. To proceed, you may need to whitelist the executable and the ZIP folder in your antivirus software or temporarily disable it during download, extraction, and execution.

When downloading the ZIP folder, ensure that your antivirus software does not automatically quarantine or delete it. You may need to adjust your antivirus settings to allow the download and extraction of the ZIP folder. Once downloaded, extract the contents to a location of your choice on your computer.

If you encounter any issues or have concerns about the safety of the system, please feel free to do your own research or seek assistance from other sources.
